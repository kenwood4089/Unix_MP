#In this task, you are required to edit Aesop's "The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing" 
#You must convert all animals to upper case
#Example: Bat -> BAT

A Bat fell on the ground and was caught by a Weasel. It begged the Weasel to spare its life, but
the Weasel refused. It told the Bat that birds, by nature, were its enemy. The Bat assured him that
it was not a bird, it was a mouse. The Weasel thought a moment, then set it free. A while later,
the Bat fell again to the ground, and it was caught by another Weasel. It begged this Weasel not to
eat him, either. The Weasel, though, said it did not like mice at all and would eat it. The Bat
told the Weasel that it was not a mouse, but a bat. The second Weasel had no good answer, so he let
it go.
